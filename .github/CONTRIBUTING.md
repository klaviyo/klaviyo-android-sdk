# Welcome to Klaviyo SDK contributing guide

Thank you for considering contributing to the Klaviyo Android SDK!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from engaging in discussion to 
opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

### Discussions and questions

Discussions are enabled for this repo in order to reduce the friction of getting set up and using
the SDK in your projects. Don't hesitate to [dive in](https://github.com/klaviyo/klaviyo-android-sdk/discussions) 
to the discussions, or open a new topic if you don't see what you're looking for.

### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, or want to suggest a new feature, first 
[search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments).
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/klaviyo/klaviyo-android-sdk/issues/new/choose).

### Solve an issue

If you want to recommend a code fix for an existing issue, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

1. Fork the repository and clone to your machine, open in Android Studio 
1. Once the project has synced, run `./gradlew addKtlintFormatGitPreCommitHook` to install our
   pre-commit code formatting rules. 
1. We recommend selecting the `productionDebug` build variant to make use of our debug logging.
1. Make your changes to the SDK. While we encourage test-driven development, we will not require 
   unit tests to submit a PR. That said, tests are an easy way to verify your changes as you go. 
   We have a very high coverage rate, so there are plenty of examples to follow.
1. We also encourage you to test your changes against your own app. First, add [mavenLocal](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html#sec:case-for-maven-local) 
   as the first repository in your gradle file. Then run the following command to compile a local copy 
   of the SDK for your app to consume. *Remember to remove `mavenLocal` when you're finished.*
   ```
   .gradlew publishToMavenLocal
   ``` 
1. Commit the changes once you are happy with them, please include a detailed commit message. 

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers
  understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link the PR to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) 
  if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) 
  so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your 
  proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) 
  or pull request comments.  
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- Alternatively, we may incorporate your suggestions into another feature branch and communicate 
  progress in the original issue or PR.
