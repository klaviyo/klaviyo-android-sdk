/**
 * fixtures is exactly what it sounds like:
 * a module for sharing test fixtures without duplicating effort.
 *
 * This follows a slightly unconventional pattern in that testing code is part of the main package
 * however as long as this module is only depended upon with `testImplementation` there's no leakage
 * of test code into production environment. I adopted this strategy from here
 * https://blog.danlew.net/2022/08/16/sharing-code-between-test-modules/
 *
 * As a side note, "test fixtures" in gradle are now meant to be a first class feature in gradle
 * using `java-test-fixtures` but this method does not yet work in android+kotlin projects,
 * according to my research and testing as of Feb 2023.
